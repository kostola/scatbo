# Scatbo

Scatbo (SCAla Telegram BOts) is actually a set of libraries that simplify the creation of [Telegram Bots](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution) in Scala.

I hope that it can evolve into a complete framework.
Contact me if you want to help me improve it.

Actually there isn't any form of precompiled libraries, so the only way to use Scatbo is to compile it by yourself.

## Dependencies

To build Scatbo you need:

 - Scala 2.11.7
 - SBT 0.13.8

## How to build

After you've installed the required stuff, simply use `sbt compile` inside the root of the repo.

## Disclaimer

This is my first project in Scala, so probably you'll find a LOT of mistakes inside the code. Again, any help would be really appreciated.
